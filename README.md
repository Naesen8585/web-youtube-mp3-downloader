# web-youtube-mp3-downloader

This project aims to provide a web interface which will allow extraction of audio files from youtube videos.

To install this, all you need to do is run

`bash install_webytdl.bash` In the directory that you download from Git.

You will be prompted which port number you want it to run on, and then when installation is completed, you will be prompted to reboot.

Once rebooted, you will be able to access your server at `your IP Address:Your Port Number`

To use it, All you need to do is paste the address of the Youtube video you want to extract the link from. Select the type of audio file you'd like to be ripped from the video, and then submit the data. You'll see the pretty `Processing` animation until the data is extracted and converted, and then you will be prompted to download it from your browser. This works with mobile browsers too!
